description: 'A note about how new continents are not discovered by map, but when the ship veers off course and the captain makes a "mistake".'
---

New continents are not discovered by following maps. They're discovered when the ship veers off course. When the captain makes a "mistake". When someone decides to sail not where the compass points, but toward the place where, rumor has it, dragons dwell.
