  The answer doesn’t need an arsenal of external props-no money, no outside approval, no perfect setup. It’s already in you once you stop scrambling and start listening. You don’t need superpowers, piles of cash, or anyone’s permission to face what’s gnawing at you. It’s already there-just stop spiraling.
