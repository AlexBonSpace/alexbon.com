title: Have you ever thought about how a pearl is born? A grain of sand gets inside the shell. A foreign body. An irritant. Pain. And to protect itself from this pain, to isolate this splinter, the mollusk begins to cover it layer by layer with nacre. Year after year. It doesn't try to create a masterpiece. It simply tries to soothe the pain. And as a result of this long, agonizing, unconscious process, something beautiful is born.
