title: War is a perfect predatory mechanism that solves cold, mathematical problems of survival and dominance. But this mechanism is utterly helpless and cannot start without its irrational fuel — a great and simple story that convinces millions of rational beings that their personal, agonizing death has cosmic significance. War is a marriage of ruthless biology and high poetry. Wars begin when a story appears that transforms killing from a crime into a sacred duty.
