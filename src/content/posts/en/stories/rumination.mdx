  A story about a man who checks his sent email over and over. Three paragraphs to a client — and an entire day lost to anxiety about how it sounded.
---

Anton checked the email for the fourth time. Three paragraphs to a client. Routine approval. He read it over, changed a word, changed it back.

Sent. A second later, he was checking if it went through.

It did.

He opened his sent folder. Read it again. Found a phrase that now seemed harsh. Or did it? He couldn't tell. He imagined the client reading it. Frowning. Thinking — what an idiot.

He texted his wife: "Do you think this sounds okay?" — and sent her a screenshot.

She replied: "Yeah, it's fine. Again?"

He didn't respond.

He opened the email once more. Maybe he should send a clarification? No, that would be weird. Or would it?

By lunch, he still hadn't started his main work. The report that would have taken two hours sat untouched. Instead — three drafts he was afraid to send, and a news feed he'd fallen into while "resting" from the tension.

That evening, his wife asked: "How was your day?"

"Exhausted," he said.
