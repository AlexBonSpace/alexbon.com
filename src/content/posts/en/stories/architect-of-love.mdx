description: A man builds universes from the crumbs of someone else's life and then demolishes them the moment there is a risk of being seen without his roles.

Alexei was a brilliant architect. He just didn't build houses, he built worlds for other people. He could listen. Not the polite nodding kind - he listened with his entire body, like an archeologist kneeling above an untouched tomb, certain that a soul was full of treasure.

He remembered everything. The offhand confession that she once wanted to captain a ship. The way she always picked that ridiculous lemon cupcake at the bakery. The cheap plastic whale keychain she clipped on because “it's funny”.

From that “trash”, from all those forgotten crumbs, he built her a universe.

He could shake her awake at midnight to drive to the river “because tonight's wind belongs to captains”. He could comb half the city for that cupcake “because a day without it is wasted”. Once he crafted a long, solemn story about how her plastic whale swam every ocean just to find its owner again.

She listened, laughed, and fell in love. Not so much with him as with the version of herself he reflected back. The woman whose tiniest quirks gained weight and meaning inside his world. With him she felt not just loved. She felt *seen*.

The bonfire of passion roared toward the sky. In that glow, both of them were blinded, because while the fire burns, nobody watches the logs.

But every fire dies. Once the palace is finished, the architect has nothing left to do. After the celebratory fireworks fade, ordinary days arrive.

Ordinary days where two people simply sit together and drink tea. In that ordinariness no architecture is needed. You just have to *be*. And Alexei had no idea how to do that.

He was terrified that once the smoke of his grand constructions cleared, the woman would finally look at him. For real. Not at the architect, not at the archeologist, not at the magician. At Alexei himself.

And she would find... nothing special.

Not a monster. Not a villain. Something worse. An ordinary, tired human. A person with fears, with flimsy habits, with no answers to every question. Someone who sometimes wants silence simply because he is exhausted.

Exposure felt like death. His greatest fear wasn't being left. It was being studied and hearing a polite, “Oh, that's all you are. I see.”

So the moment the flames dimmed and danger approached, he began dismantling the palace himself. He grew cold, nitpicky, picked fights. He manufactured reasons to leave.

He started to destroy. Slowly, coolly, methodically.

He stopped noticing her uniqueness and catalogued her flaws instead. The dream about the ship became, in his retelling, “childish naivety”. The lemon cupcake was “a silly habit”. During one argument he smirked and tossed at her:

- What are we even supposed to talk about if the peak of your joy is a plastic whale?

He took the very treasures he once unearthed and turned them into weapons against her. He did it so she would believe in her own “insignificance”.

It was easier that way. All the guilt landed on her shoulders.

He always left first. She stayed among the ruins, sifting through the shards of her enchanted world, sobbing and searching for the moment she had ruined everything.

He left her holding the blame so no one would ever suspect his fear.
